Learning data science through building projects


Day 001: This might be too soon but have been working on an ANN project. Have implemented the core algorithms in @AndrewYNg 's class but this is the first time I have applied it in a real world problem. Still polishing the code.

Day002: Polished up my notebook on peak detection using a neural network. With the lack of real labeled data, I worked around the problem using simulated peak data. This made my machine learning problem a lot easier.

Day003: Taking a deep dive into principal component analysis. Never taken linear algebra before so I am pretty confused about eigenvectors. Starting with basic linear algebra and working my way to gaining a fundamental understanding of PCA. 

Day004 and 005: Progress has been slow last two days. Still going through the linear algebra essentials. @3blue1brown has a great video series walking you through the graphical intuition of linear algebra.

Day006: finally watched through the linear algebra series by @3blue1brown. Moving on to understanding single value decomposition and eigendecomposition.

Day007 and 008: Got a general understanding of the math behind PCA. Now starting a mini project to denoise an image using PCA 

Day009. Used PCA to denoise an image. It worked somewhat but it's not as good as a boxcar average. Still trying. 

Day010 and 011. PCA to denoise an image. Borrowed some ideas from this paper, which uses local pixel grouping and block matching to build a training set. Also messed around with Kmeans. Not happy with the results yet.

Day 012 and 013: Have been working on image denoising using PCA for several days. Still doesn't work well. Going to polish it up and upload to github anyways. Moving on to other topics and revisit this later.

Day 014: polished up my notebook on image denoising using PCA. Going to branch out to learn something else. Probably enroll in a data science course.
